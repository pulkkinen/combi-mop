### Multiobjective optimization for cell line MALME-3M using the NCI ALMANAC

NCI ALMANAC: [Holbeck SL, et al. (2017) The National Cancer Institute ALMANAC: A Comprehensive Screening Resource for the Detection of Anticancer Drug Pairs with Enhanced Therapeutic Activity. Cancer Res. 77(13):3564â€“3576.]

This Jupyter notebook performs biobjective optimization of therapeutic and nonselective effects of drug combinations based on the NCI ALMANAC data.
The code takes a tensor of type (60, 104, 104, 5, 5) as input Q, where 60 is the number of cell lines in the NCI-60, 104 is the total number of drug compounds. For each pair of drugs (the tensor is symmetric with respect to interchange of second and third indices) on each of the 60 cell lines, there is a 5x5 matrix which have the drug concentrations as the first column and the first row, and the growth inhibition values normalized to [0,1] as a 4x4 submatrix. The value 0 indicates complete inhibition, and the value 1 means that the combination had no effect on the growth rate at that pair of concentrations.

In order to apply this notebook to a different dataset, the parameters for numbers of cell lines (nCellLines), number of drugs (nDrugs), and number of concentrations (nConcentrations) for each drug in the combination matrices need to be re-defined below. Although the biobjective optimization, that is, finding Pareto optimal combinations by using the epsilon-constraint method is quite general, and can be done just by running the code with the re-defined parameters and an associated input tensor, the full list of features, such as highlighting special combinations with specific colors, can be only achieved by going through the code line-by-line. Also, naming the drugs and cell lines helps in performing searches and in the analysis of results.
